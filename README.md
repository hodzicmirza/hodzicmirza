# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mirza Hodžić

**Full-Stack Developer | Linux & DevOps Enthusiast | Cybersecurity Explorer**

## 🔹 About Me

I'm a developer with a deep passion for both building applications and understanding how systems work under the hood. My journey started with full-stack development, but it quickly expanded into the world of Linux servers, networking, and cybersecurity. I love the entire ecosystem—from writing clean code to deploying and securing applications on my own infrastructure.

🌟 **What excites me?**
- Building full-stack web applications with **.NET** and **Angular/React**
- Managing and securing **Linux servers** (my daily driver is Arch, btw 😉)
- Setting up **Cloudflare Tunnels** and **Docker** containers for deployment
- Exploring **Cybersecurity** — understanding threats, securing systems, and ethical hacking
- Automating everything with scripts and DevOps practices
